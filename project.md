All of these are obstacles for potential creators and their collections.

## How TrueDrop.io Works?

At TrueDrop, we’re excited to announce our use of the ERC-721A NFT smart contract for our decentralized NFT launchpad platform. The ERC-721A standard is an extension of the popular ERC-721 standard, with additional features that allow for more flexibility and control over NFT contracts.

ERC721A is a gas-efficient implementation of the common ERC721 standard used by notable projects to mint multiple NFTs in batches. ERC721A supports minting multiple tokens for close to the cost of one. With the ERC721A standard being used, everyone can definitely mint NFT on [TrueDrop.io](http://truedrop.io/) at an extremely cheap cost even in large quantities.

## Testnet Experience

### Why you should try Testnet on TrueDrop?

If you are not ready to launch your own NFT collection for a variety of reasons, consider creating them using Testnet on [truedrop.io](http://truedrop.io/). 

- **Testing**: By launching on a testnet, creators can test the functionality of their NFTs and ensure that everything works as expected. This can help identify and fix any bugs or errors before the NFT is launched on the mainnet.
- **Cost-effective**: Testnet typically do not require real cryptocurrency to be used, you can get free Testnet Token
- **Experimentation**: Testnet provides a safe environment for experimenting with new ideas and features that might not be possible or cost-effective on the mainnet.
- **Community feedback**: Testnet allows creators to get feedback from the community and make adjustments before the final launch on the mainnet.

TrueDrop.io makes it easy to create and deploy your NFT collection on testnet.
